Proposal
What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Discord encouragement bot

In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
A bot in discord server that gives encouragement and insults

In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
For this project we will be having an discord bot that will exacute encouragement and insults base off the bot command typed.Our bot will be exacuting base off the commands that is inserted which can only be -p encourge me or -p insult.For the insult command to work, a person will need to type -p insult and the person's discord ID for this comand to work then the bot will use an algorithm to implent insults. On the other hand encouragement will work an little different, for this command you need to -p encourage me without needing the discord ID.The bot will then start encouraging you base off simple text back and forth. When complicated words are typed the bot will end the conversation .Additionally if we were able to finish on time we might even add more bot commends such as playing music commands.

In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
I will have an bot implemented in my discord server

In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
I will have an bot implemented in my discord server working to some extend without implenting an algorithm.

In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
I will have my bot implemented in my discord server fully working and ready to do whats commanded.

In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
After deciding on what I will be working on for this final project there will be an few numbers of steps and new skills I will be needing.First of all, I will be needing the skills to implement an discord bot so I will naturally to some research on how to implement an discord bot. Some additional skills that I may need acquire for this project would be some navigation skills. For this Project Im working along side two group members Anna and Zhiyi, and for this project we will be breaking it down into 2 sections frontend and backend. Anna will be doing the frontend of our project while Zhiyi will be doing the backend of the project, as I will be helping out with both sides and making sure everything works as intended.
